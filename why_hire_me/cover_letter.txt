Forrest,

As I struggle to come up with something to write for this cover letter (which will probably be the hardest part of this
whole exercise!), I feel like it might be best to just call out some of my core values.

Simplicity
Simpler may be more code or less elegant than other choices, but it wins in the long term. Future Dave would always
prefer to have a smaller amount of simpler code to review and understand. Following common patterns and paradigms is a
part of that too. How many times have I looked back at old code with comments like "will be needed in future" and found
no use for it? Vanilla rails, while it sounds boring, is actually my favorite flavor.

Small team means broad impact
One of the main reasons I am looking for a smaller team is to have a broader impact on the product(s) and more chances
to branch out and grow. The roles seem to get narrower and narrower as the org gets larger, which is not where I want
to go.

Measurement and observability
I am the guy who likes to have a monitor full of charts that show various aspects of the system. The "is it up?" check
is valuable but not very helpful at 2AM when an alert fires that says it is down. Building in real time measurement into
the code can expose all kinds of valuable insights. Who wants to look at logs?

Craftsmanship
Do I just want to build something or build something that I want to be proud of? I am ok with making mistakes and having
bugs but do not want them to happen all the time.

Testing
Most of the time I can quickly look at a project and tell if they used TDD or not. It is much easier to start a project
with tests than bolt them on later! Who wants to refactor in a project or app that doesn't have tests?

Have an impact on people
For my next role, I am looking for a company that is really focused on helping people enrich or enhance their lives. The
value of fortune and glory has gone down for me and I would rather have the thanks and appreciation that comes from
people.

Thanks for your consideration!
